Antibiotics are the single most effective medical tool for the treatment of bacterial infections. These drugs work by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria, while generally being non-toxic to human cells. 

Unfortunately, the excessive application of antibiotics can [promote the emergence of drug-resistant strains of bacteria](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25271470/). As a result, clinicians have increasingly begun to [employ multiple antibiotics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17997179/) in combination. 

This may seem like an intuitively sensible approach; using more than one drug should result in a more effective treatment, since the bugs are unlikely to be resistant to both of the antibiotics. And, indeed, such positive synergism between drugs is often observed. 

However, paradoxically, using multiple antibiotics together can [sometimes be less effective](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919223/) than would be predicted based on the efficacy of the individual drugs alone.

[A recent study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36198788/), published in the journal Nature, has explored this phenomenon in more detail, and the results are intriguing. Using a novel high-throughput cell viability assay, the authors measured the impact of antibiotic combinations on a species of bacteria called Stephylococcus aureus, which can cause a variety of skin and lung infections. 

They first measured the bacterial growth inhibition and killing effects of the drugs in isolation and in combination over a 90-minute period, finding many instances of negative synergy between the combinations used. However, in all such cases, the repression was ‘non-reciprocal’, meaning that one of the two drugs was still exerting an effect. Such repression is typically observed between ‘bactericidal’ (bacteria-killing) and ‘bacteriostatic’ (bacterial growth-inhibiting) drugs; the activity of the latter impede the activity of the former.

In contrast, when the authors examined long-term clearance of the bacteria, at an 8-hour time point, they found that reciprocal repression was widespread. In other words, both drugs were inactivated by the combination. 

This could sometimes be predicted from the shorter time-series data, but not always. Indeed, extrapolating from the earlier time points would in some cases be downright misleading, since the synergistic interactions was found to change over time. 

What is perhaps most striking about the results of this study is the breadth of combinations of different compounds that were exhaustively tested. The authors used a very diverse set of drugs, testing a total of 63 unique multidrug combinations. In all cases, clearance of bacteria at the later time point was always worse than when using individual compounds.

The impact appears to be very closely linked to the metabolism of the bacteria, because when the authors used compounds that do not interfere with metabolism, the ability to clear bacteria was greatly enhanced. It therefore seems likely that, in many cases, the observed negative synergy arises because one of a combination of drugs targets metabolism while the other requires the bacteria to be metabolically active for its effect.

There is clearly much to learn about the complex interplay of these different classes of antibiotic. The results from this study provide a solid starting point from which to tackle key further questions and fully understand the ramifications for the medical application of these essential drugs.
