I have recently been working on a very exciting project in collaboration with Dr Odiri Eneje (Papworth Hospital) and Professor Andres Floto (University of Cambridge) as well as partners at GlaxoSmithKline and the University of Exeter, in which we are monitoring epigenetic status and gene expression in CF patient myeloid (immune) cells across a time series during a period of acute pulmonary exacerbation.

We will soon release a preprint of the results of this analysis, but in an effort to make these data more easily accessible, I have created two Shiny apps for exploring exploring gene expression in CF patients and matched healthy volunteers (HV). Simply type the name of a gene to see interactive expression profiles, or multiple gene names to perform automated clustering by group.

These can be accessed at the below links:
