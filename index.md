# Welcome to my personal blog

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge and in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge.
My principal research interest is in the development and application of computational methods for functional genomic annotation using large scale data sets
from bacteria, viruses, and humans.

I completed my PhD at University College Dublin, where I received a fellowship from the Wellcome Trust as part of the Computational Infection Biology
programme.

Since graduating, I have worked with Professor Andrew Firth in the Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, and more recently with Professor
Andres Floto in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge.

I will use this space to discuss bioinformatics, data visualisation, machine learning, genomics, genetics and related topics. Please feel free to contact me if you
would like to discuss anything further with me.
